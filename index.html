      <h3>What it does</h3>
      <p>Throttle allows you to click a button (or perform any action) 
        as many times as you want, however it limits the number of times
        that the funtion will be executed. This leads to a delayed response
        for every action that's triggered. Throttle does not care about if 
        a user is clicking or not when the time limit is over. It will just
        fire one more time and then stop.
