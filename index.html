  <h2 class="title">Throttle vs. Debounce - Ultimate smackdown</h2>
  <p>The buttons both change color when clicked, and both have a one second timer set. <br> Play around with clicking them at different intervals to see if you can figure out the difference.</p>
  <div class='buttons'>
    <div class="left">
      <button class='throttle' onClick={colorChange()}>throttle</button>
      <h3>What it does</h3>
      <p>
        Throttle allows you to click a button (or perform any action) 
        as many times as you want, however it limits the number of times
        that the funtion will be executed. This leads to a delayed response
        for every action that's triggered. Throttle does not care about if 
        a user is clicking or not when the time limit is over. It will just
        fire one more time and then stop.
      </p>
      <h3>How to remember it</h3>
      <p>
        The throttle function limits how many callbacks can be made within a given period of time. It 
        doesn't have any impact on the speed that the first call is made (so you get fast response), 
        and the length you wait between calls is strictly determined by the 
        Timeout you set.
      </p>
      <h3>Code</h3>

    <div class="right">
      <button class='debounce' onClick={adjustColor()}>debounce</button>
      <h3>What it does</h3>
      <p>
        Debounce is simpler in my opinion than throttle. Debounce will trigger
        only once, and it happens when the action has finished AND a timeout 
        has completely run. This could be useful for something like typing 
        in a search bar or resizing a window where you want something to be
        done before you fire the callback. 
      </p>
      <h3>How to remember it</h3>
      <p>
        Debounce is like that friend who will always come through and do what 
        you asked but they'll literally wait until you asked so long ago that 
        you forgot anyway. 
      </p>
      <h3>Code</h3>
      <img class='image' src="images/debounce.png" alt="debounce">
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Ultimately these are both fine ways of improving performance on a website. It just depends what kind of functionality you're looking for.</p>
